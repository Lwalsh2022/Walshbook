# Walshbook

This is an API for a social media web application like Facebook, where users can share thoughts, create friend lists and react to their friend's thoughts. It uses MongoDB to create a database, Express.js to create routes, the Mongoose ODM and Moment.js to create timestamps. It uses Insomnia to seed the database.
